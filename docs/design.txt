Front end design principles
1. View logic should prepare data only for display and never modify the model.
2. Controller logic should never directly create, update, or delete data from the model.
3. The client should never directly access the data store.



sprint 2 -- add a filter on the left of the property list
========================================
The search flter need to be carefully designed. The filter must be restful, meaning when select a city link or/and a rental type link, the url will be updated accrodingly. when type in an url, the filter must be updated accrodingly. e.g.

click city link,  url= /listing/$city
click type link, url=/listing/all/$type
click city then click type, url=/listing/$city/$type
click tye, url=/listing/all/$type, then click city url=/listing/$city/$type
